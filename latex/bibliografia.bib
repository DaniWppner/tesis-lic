  abstract  = {Smart contracts are immutable programs deployed on the blockchain that can manage significant assets. Because of this, verification and validation of smart contracts is of vital importance. Indeed, it is industrial practice to hire independent specialized companies to audit smart contracts before deployment. Auditors typically rely on a combination of tools and experience but still fail to identify problems in smart contracts before deployment, causing significant losses. In this paper, we propose using predicate abstraction to construct models which can be used by auditors to explore and validate smart contact behaviour at the function call level by proposing predicates that expose different aspects of the contract. We propose predicates based on requires clauses and enum-type state variables as a starting point for contract validation and report on an evaluation on two different benchmarks.},

  abstract   = {Code artifacts that have nontrivial requirements with respect to the ordering in which their methods or procedures ought to be called are common and appear, for instance, in the form of API implementations and objects. This work addresses the problem of validating if API implementations provide their intended behavior when descriptions of this behavior are informal, partial, or nonexistent. The proposed approach addresses this problem by generating abstract behavior models which resemble typestates. These models are statically computed and encode all admissible sequences of method calls. The level of abstraction at which such models are constructed has shown to be useful for validating code artifacts and identifying findings which led to the discovery of bugs, adjustment of the requirements expected by the engineer to the requirements implicit in the code, and the improvement of available documentation.},
