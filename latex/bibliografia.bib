  abstract  = {Smart contracts are immutable programs deployed on the blockchain that can manage significant assets. Because of this, verification and validation of smart contracts is of vital importance. Indeed, it is industrial practice to hire independent specialized companies to audit smart contracts before deployment. Auditors typically rely on a combination of tools and experience but still fail to identify problems in smart contracts before deployment, causing significant losses. In this paper, we propose using predicate abstraction to construct models which can be used by auditors to explore and validate smart contact behaviour at the function call level by proposing predicates that expose different aspects of the contract. We propose predicates based on requires clauses and enum-type state variables as a starting point for contract validation and report on an evaluation on two different benchmarks.},

  abstract   = {Code artifacts that have nontrivial requirements with respect to the ordering in which their methods or procedures ought to be called are common and appear, for instance, in the form of API implementations and objects. This work addresses the problem of validating if API implementations provide their intended behavior when descriptions of this behavior are informal, partial, or nonexistent. The proposed approach addresses this problem by generating abstract behavior models which resemble typestates. These models are statically computed and encode all admissible sequences of method calls. The level of abstraction at which such models are constructed has shown to be useful for validating code artifacts and identifying findings which led to the discovery of bugs, adjustment of the requirements expected by the engineer to the requirements implicit in the code, and the improvement of available documentation.},

From the initial cryptocurrency to the current smart contract, blockchain has been applied to many fields. Although there are some studies on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, there lacks a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We also review the security enhancement solutions for blockchain, which could be used in the development of various blockchain systems, and suggest some future directions to stir research efforts into this area.}

In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptions on the ``hashing power'' of the adversary relative to network synchronicity; we show our results to be tight under high synchronization.},

Although classic distributed consensus algorithms made significant contributions to the development of blockchain consensus protocols, there are still many issues to be resolved due to the complexity and diversity of the blockchain. In this survey, we summarize the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. We first introduce the theoretical basis, models, and challenges of blockchain consensus protocols. Then, we present the existing blockchain protocols in the categories of proof-based protocols, committee-based protocols, and other miscellaneous protocols. Finally, we analyze their performance and discuss future research directions by comparing existing protocols.},
